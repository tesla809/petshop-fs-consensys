# PetShop for 2022

Truffle's Petshop circa 2022 with Solidity 0.8.10 and modern tooling.

It will cover:

- React with MetaMask
- Using current popular DeFi primitives
- Using testing, fuzzing, gas optimization
- Other tools and best practices

The idea is to create a full-stack DApp which has the best practices and leading ideas in smart contract development for 2022, which can serve as a guide for others.

We will have one context, Truffle's Petshop example, which will be scaled in all sorts of ways.

Say, the PetShop wants to go national, so it needs a bond. Ok, let's use the ERC1400 standard to create something legally investable by large corporations, etc.

Along the way, things will be very well documented.

Will it be perfect? Nope. I will be learning about some topics as well.

See an error? Please open an issue and let me know what needs fixing.
